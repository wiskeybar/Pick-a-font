#Pick'a'font
This is pick'a'font, a prototype of something i've been searching for. 
## Pick'a'font uses
Pick'a'font helps determine if the font you've chosen is the right one for the background your using. 
### How 
There are ten boxes inside this app and each of them gets a slightly brigher color. Fonts 'downgrade', that is - they become darker. When you choose your font and background color you can decide what suits you the most.
### Fonts 
I wanted this app to work with google-fonts API, but since I'm running no backend and don't like the idea of hiding my key in 'plain sight' i chose not to do that and instead I'm just using 10 most popular Google Fonts from a CDN. This obviously is not how it's suppose to work.
